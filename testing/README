This directory contains packages that are being tested.  The SlackBuilds
may be unfinished and may not build correctly.  Some of these packages have
additional dependencies that are not in the repo yet.  Dependencies  will
be noted in a README and may be added here as time permits.  More packages
may be added here over time.  The mate-build-testing.sh script is provided
as a convenience but since all the dependencies might not be in the msb
repo yet, the script may or may not work.  Essentially, /testing is just
that -- testing and the user may need to take additional steps to get these
packages to build and install.
