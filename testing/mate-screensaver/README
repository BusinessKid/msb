mate-screensaver builds and installs fine but does not seem to work in my
testing -- at least, the lock screen functionality does not seem to work. I
removed xscreensaver to see if that conflicted but still no locking.  It is
possible I just didn't give it enough testing so I would welcome testing on
this package since it probably works but I just couldn't get it going for some
reason.
