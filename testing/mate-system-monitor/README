Process viewer and system resource monitor for MATE
This package allows you to graphically view and manipulate the 
running processes on your system.  It also provides an overview of 
available resources such as CPU and memory

mate-system-monitor requires libgtop, gtkmm, and glibmm

gtkmm and glibmm are available on SlackBuilds Project (SBo)

To make it easier, we have provided the queue file for sbopkg that
can be used to automatically download, build, and install all 
dependencies of mate-system-monitor.

You will need to download sbopkg (http://sbopkg.org/), 
create/update slackbuilds repo (sbopkg -r), move the queue file to 
/var/lib/sbopkg/queue, load the mate-system-monitor queue 
through sbopkg and start processing it.
