The following is list of to-do items for MATE on Slackware:

Wed Apr  3 14:26:41 UTC 2013
Provide dependencies for testing/mate-system-monitor. For now, you can build
the needed packages from SBo.

Fri Mar 22 16:47:15 UTC 2013
Determine whether mate-polkit is really needed or whether MATE can rely on
polkit-gnome which is installed by default in Slackware.  This was discussed
with upstream MATE developer in IRC who thought that mate-polkit was still
required.
