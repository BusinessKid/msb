The following is a list of notes on building MATE on Slackware -current:

Fri Jul 19 15:34:10 UTC 2013
Current MATE 1.7 development (future MATE 1.8) is replacing mate-doc-utils
with yelp-tools.  This change requires yelp-tools and yelp-xsl to be added to
deps/.  Both require itstool, which is already available on Slackware
-current, so there is no need to build itstool if you are using Slackware
-current. 

Mon Jun 24 01:38:36 UTC 2013
mate-media is reported to be broken on -current (but not on Slackware 14.0
despite the same version is being used).  The fix for this issue is to use the
precompiled binary packages for Slackware 14.0 which is reported to be working
fine on Slackware -current.

Pat has rebuilt xdg-utils in Slackware -current to properly support MATE DE,
so xdg-utils patch is no longer needed in Slackware -current, but running
these two commands as normal user are still needed to set caja as the default
handler:

xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop inode/directory
xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop application/x-directory

please make a backup of your $HOME/.local/share/applications/defaults.list
before executing the above commands

Another note about the addition of dconf to Slackware -current.  If you
previously built MATE packages with the dconf in the MATE SlackBuilds /deps
directory, you'll need to rebuild the following packages using the new dconf
in -current:

base/mate-control-center
base/mate-panel
base/mate-settings-daemon
extra/mate-terminal

Pat just added dconf to Slackware -current and dconf is included as a
dependency package in the /base directory.  So, if you are building MATE on
-current with Pat's new dconf installed, you shouldn't need to build the dconf
package in the MATE SlackBuild repository.  And if you are using the
mate-build-base.sh script, then please edit that script and remove line 52:

dconf \

And then proceed with running the script.  Please report any issues.  Thanks!
