mate-file-manager-image-converter is an extension to Caja which
allows the user to resize or rotate images from Caja

If you have other DE installed (eg. XFCE), the default application
used to open a file system may not be caja (the File Manager in MATE), so
some extensions may not showed up properly.

You need to change some settings in order for extension to work:
- Go to System >  Preferences > Preferred Applications
- Go to System tab
- Set the File Manager field to Open Folder
