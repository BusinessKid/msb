This directory contains extra packages for the MATE desktop environment.  None
of them are required for basic functionality, but instead are extra additions
or additional software or plugins.  Some of them may have additional
dependencies that will be noted in a README and that may be added here as time
permits.  Working packages will be added to the 'mate-build-extra.sh' script.
More packages may be added here over time.

Note: gtksourceview in /deps (a dependency of mate-text-editor) has been
downgraded from a development version in SlackBuilds.org.  If you are running
Slackware 14.0, the gtksourceview from SBo is fine and you can remove
gtksourceview from the list of packages to built in the mate-build-extra.sh
script.  However, if you are running Slackware -current, then the
gtksourceview from SBo won't build so you can use the one in the /deps
directory.
