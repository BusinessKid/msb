MATE 1.6 to 1.8 Upgrade HOWTO

This document explains how to upgrade from MATE 1.6 to MATE 1.8 on
Slackware Linux 14.1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin, we strongly recommend making a backup of your system, or,
if not the entire system, at least the /etc and your home directory.  You
might find that you need to refer to a few things after the upgrade process
is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.

OK, now that everything is safely backed up, let's proceed. :-)

You will need the MATE 1.8 packages available on your local system.  Grab
them from the official repository at http://www.slackware.org.uk/msb/ or
any of the mirror sites.  Due to the fact that MATE 1.8 has new, obsoleted,
and renamed packages, we do not recommend upgrading using slackpkg+ or
other similar utility.

0.  Log out from the MATE desktop.

1.  Upgrade and install all new MATE 1.8 packages:

    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/base/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/extra/*.txz

2.  Remove obsolete packages:

    removepkg mate-file-manager-gksu
    removepkg mate-file-manager-image-converter
    removepkg mate-file-manager-open-terminal
    removepkg mate-file-manager-sendto
    removepkg mate-keyring
    removepkg libmatekeyring
    removepkg mate-doc-utils
    removepkg libmatewnck
    removepkg mate-character-map
    removepkg mate-bluetooth

3.  Remove renamed packages:

    removepkg mate-file-manager
    removepkg mate-window-manager
    removepkg mate-document-viewer
    removepkg mate-image-viewer
    removepkg mate-file-archiver
    removepkg mate-menu-editor
    removepkg mate-text-editor

    You will notice some messages that that some of the files are found in
    other packages and are not be deleted.  That's fine, since these files
    are included in new packages with a new name in MATE 1.8 (see
    MATE-1.8-CHANGES.TXT).

4.  Remove PAM-related packages (optional):

    If you happened to install pam/pam_unix2 packages in MATE 1.6 to get
    mate-screensaver working for desktop locking feature, you will be glad
    to know that mate-screensaver is now moved to extra/ and no longer
    needs the pam and pam_unix2 libraries anymore.  So, if you
    installed them for MATE 1.6, these two packages can be safely deleted:

    removepkg pam
    removepkg pam_unix2

5.  Run xwmconfig and select xinitrc.mate-session. This ensures you get the
    latest copy of xinitrc.mate-session due to changes in mate-session-
    manager.  ALWAYS run this command for both new installations or upgrades
    from MATE 1.6

At this point you should be running MATE 1.8 on Slackware 14.1.  :-)  If
you have installed everything from base/ and extra/ (which will include
packages from the deps/ directory) then you should have a total of 62
packages:

    $ ls /var/log/packages | grep _msb | wc -l
      62

We wish everyone good luck with this!
