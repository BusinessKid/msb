MATE 1.12 to 1.14 Upgrade HOWTO
<mateslackbuilds@gmail.com>

This document explains how to upgrade from MATE 1.12 on Slackware 14.1 to
MATE 1.14 on Slackware Linux 14.2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
This procedure assumes you are upgrading from Slackware 14.1 to Slackware 14.2.
If you install Slackware 14.2 using a clean installation procedure, simply
use installpkg to install all packages in deps, base, and extra directory.

Before you begin, we strongly recommend making a backup of your system, or,
if not the entire system, at least the /etc and your home directory.  You
might find that you need to refer to a few things after the upgrade process
is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.

OK, now that everything is safely backed up, let's proceed. :-)

You will need the MATE 1.14 packages available on your local system.  Grab
them from the official repository at http://www.slackware.uk/msb/ or
any of the mirror sites.  Please note that MATE 1.14 has new and obsoleted
packages.

0.  Reboot after upgrading your Slackware 14.1 -> Slackware 14.2

1.  Upgrade and install all new MATE 1.14 packages:

    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/deps/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/base/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/extra/*.txz

2.  Remove obsolete packages:

    removepkg mate-netspeed perl-xml-twig perl-net-dbus system-tools-backends
    removepkg liboobs mate-system-tools gnome-main-menu

3.  Run xwmconfig and select xinitrc.mate-session. This ensures you get the
    latest copy of xinitrc.mate-session due to changes in mate-session-
    manager.  ALWAYS run this command for both new installations or upgrades
    from MATE 1.14

At this point you should be running MATE 1.14 on Slackware 14.2.  :-)  If
you have installed everything from /base and /extra (which will include
packages from the /deps directory) then you should have a total of 51
packages:

    $ ls /var/log/packages | grep _msb | wc -l
      51

We wish everyone good luck with this!  Please report any issues to
