MATE 1.6 to 1.8 Upgrade HOWTO  <willysr@slackware-id.org>

This document explains how to upgrade from MATE 1.6 to 1.8 in Slackware 14.1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin, I would strongly recommend making a backup of your
system, or, if not the entire system, at least the /etc and your home directory.
You might find that you need to refer to a few things after the upgrade
process is complete. Back it up, or take your chances.

OK, now that everything is safely backed up, let's proceed. :-)

To do this, you'll need the MATE 1.8 packages ready in your local system. Grab it
from official repository at http://www.slackware.org.uk/msb/ or any other mirror sites.

0.  log out from MATE Desktop

1.  Upgrade/Install all new packages from MATE 1.8

    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/base/*.txz
    upgradepkg --install-new --reinstall /path/to/extra/*.txz

2.  Remove obsolete packages
    
    removepkg mate-file-manager-gksu 
    removepkg mate-file-manager-image-converter
    removepkg mate-file-manager-open-terminal
    removepkg mate-file-manager-sendto
    removepkg mate-keyring
    removepkg libmatekeyring
    removepkg mate-doc-utils
    removepkg libmatewnck
    removepkg mate-character-map

3.  Remove renamed packages
    removepkg mate-file-manager
    removepkg mate-window-manager
    removepkg mate-document-viewer
    removepkg mate-image-viewer
    removepkg mate-file-archiver
    removepkg mate-menu-editor
    removepkg mate-text-editor

    You will notice that some of the files are found on other packages and it will not be deleted.
    That's fine, since these packages gets a new name on MATE 1.8 (see MATE-1.8-CHANGES.TXT).

At this point you should be running MATE 1.8 on Slackware 14.1.  :-)

I wish everyone good luck with this!
