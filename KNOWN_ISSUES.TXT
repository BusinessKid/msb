If you have dual monitor with NVidia card and set it up to use both monitors 
as separate, you might encountered some freeze lockup. 
The temporary workaround is to change it into Xinerama in your xorg.conf

If you run into strange panel issues, or missing icons, or theme problems,
please consider backing up or clearing out some of the hidden directories in
your $HOME, like $HOME/.config and $HOME/.cache and $HOME/.local.  If you
switch back and forth between different desktop environments, sometimes those
settings can get polluted.

Help menus and help buttons do not work -- this is a known issue per a MATE
upstream developer and scheduled to be fixed at some point but not in the next
release (1.6).

Working to determine whether mate-polkit is necessary.  According to upstream,
it is, although it results in duplicative polkit actions when a USB stick is
inserted, for example.  Disabling polkit-gnome in the "Startup Applications"
is a workaround until more testing is done.
