The following is a list of known issues with MATE on Slackware:

Sat Feb 15 01:01:47 UTC 2014
Help menus and help buttons are disabled since they require yelp which requires
more dependencies. For those interested to build yelp, you may find the SlackBuild
in testing/yelp.

By default, gksu will not work in Slackware 14.1 since shadow has been patched
to fix security vulnerabilities, but this caused gksu to be broken.
See this thread on LQ for more information
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/%5Bslackware-14-1%5D-su-c-tty-hijacking-and-some-breakage-4175486942/

The solution for this problem is easy, but since it's not yet applied upstream,
we provided a simple fix from Mancha to fix this problem.

Download the shadow source from Slackware mirror site such as
http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-14.1/source/a/shadow/
or
http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware64-14.1/source/a/shadow/

and also a patch included in testing/shadow and put it on the same folder.
Edit the shadow.SlackBuild and add this line
patch -p1 --verbose < $CWD/shadow-4.1.5.1_CVE-2005-4890_relax.diff || exit 1

before configure line and rebuild shadow package.
You can upgrade to the modified version by running:
upgradepkg /tmp/shadow-4.1.5.1-i486-2.tgz
or
upgradepkg /tmp/shadow-4.1.5.1-x86_64-2.tgz

After upgrading to the modified version, gksu will work normally.

If you are encountering problems with multiple Caja instances during loading
the MATE desktop, change this line in /usr/share/applications/caja.desktop
Exec=caja

into

Exec=caja --sync

OR

edit the caja.SlackBuild script and uncomment this line
#sed -i 's/Exec=caja/Exec=caja --sync/' data/caja.desktop.in.in
and rebuild caja again.

However, doing this will break gksu module in caja-extensions, so you can not
run applications using root account from caja's context menu anymore.

If you are encountering problems with Caja (MATE's file manager) opening
directories when clicking on files in certain programs like Dropbox, Skype,
and others, the problem is that xdg-open (part of Slackware's xdg-utils
package) does not recognize the MATE desktop and therefore defaults to opening
the directories in Firefox.  Fixes for this have been committed to xdg-utils
upstream development in Git but for now, we must apply a patch to xdg-open and
add some xdg-mime default handlers.

First, as a root user, back up /usr/bin/xdg-open and then apply the
xdg-open.patch from msb/testing/xdg-utils:

patch -p0 /usr/bin/xdg-open < /location/of/xdg-open.patch

Then, as your regular user, first back up the following file:
$HOME/.local/share/applications/defaults.list and then enter the next two
commands in a terminal to set the default handler:

xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop inode/directory
xdg-mime default caja-folder-handler.desktop application/x-directory

You should be all set.  Thanks to Totoro-kun and T3slider for reporting and
discussing this in the LQ forums and also thanks to Giorgos Keramidas for
creating the initial patch.  Here is a link to the LQ thread which also has a
link to Giorgos's blog with the patch:

If you have dual monitor with NVidia card and set it up to use both monitors
as separate, you might encounter some freeze lockup.  A temporary workaround
is to change it into TwinView in your xorg.conf

If you run into strange panel issues, or missing icons, or theme problems,
please consider backing up or clearing out some of the hidden directories in
your $HOME, like $HOME/.config and $HOME/.cache and $HOME/.local.  If you
switch back and forth between different desktop environments, sometimes those
settings can get polluted.

Working to determine whether mate-polkit is necessary.  According to upstream,
it is, although it results in duplicative polkit actions when a USB stick is
inserted, for example.  Disabling polkit-gnome in the "Startup Applications"
is a workaround until more testing is done.
