MATE SlackBuilds
================

MSB will follow MATE's workflow on versioning and releases as described in
MATE's wiki: http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/dev-doc.

Currently, there are three branches in the MSB GIT repository:

- master:  The MSB development branch.  It represents the most up-to-date
  code, but no binary packages are built from this branch.  Building from
  this branch may or may not work.  This is where the next stable release
  will come from.  Please use this branch for testing only and not for
  production environments.

- 1.6:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 14.0.  
  This is the currently supported branch and only receives bug fix updates.
  The MSB binary packages for Slackware 14.0 are built from this branch.  
  You might want to use this branch if you enjoy stable releases.
  Once Slackware 14.1 gets declared the next stable release then
  this branch will be obsoleted and no longer updated.

- 14.1-mate-1.6:  The MSB stable branch for Slackware 14.1.  
  This is the next supported branch and only receives bug fix updates.  
  The MSB binary packages for Slackware 14.1 are built from this branch.  
  You might want to use this branch if you enjoy stable releases.
  Once 'master' has been declared the next stable release (e.g. 1.8) then
  this branch will be obsoleted and no longer updated.


An easy way to find out which branch are you in right now (once you have
cloned the repo or pulled the latest updates):

$ git branch

An asterisk will appear in front of the branch you are currently in.
Example output of 'git branch':

  1.6
  14.1-mate-1.6
* master

This output indicates that you are now in the 'master' branch.

To switch to another branch, use 'git checkout <branch_name>'.  Example:

$ git checkout 1.6
$ git branch

* 1.6
  14.1-mate-1.6
  master

You have now switched from the 'master' branch to the '1.6' branch.
